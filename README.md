## 🔧 Projects Overview

### 📘 ATmega128 – Assembly
An introductory project using the ATmega128 microcontroller to practice low-level programming with assembly language.

**Topics covered:**
- Register manipulation
- Arithmetic and logic operations
- Loops and conditional statements
- Basic input/output control

---

### 📗 PIC24FJ128GA705 – Embedded C
A project exploring embedded C programming on the PIC24FJ128GA705 microcontroller.

**Topics covered:**
- GPIO setup and control
- Interrupt service routines
- Timer and counter configuration
- Peripheral interfacing (LEDs, buttons)

---

### ⚙️ Digilent Arty Z7-10 – FPGA
An initial project using the **FPGA fabric** of the Digilent Arty Z7-10 board (Zynq-7000 SoC) to implement simple digital logic circuits.

📁 Folder: `zaj1_18.10.2024`

**Features:**
- Reading input from switches and buttons
- Controlling LEDs based on input logic
- Introductory use of **Vivado** for synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation

> 🛑 Note: Although the Arty Z7-10 includes an ARM microcontroller (Processing System), this project focuses solely on the FPGA (Programmable Logic) to build a foundation in digital hardware design.
