Add SREG register to see flags.

C (Carry):
The Carry flag is set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry out of the most significant bit (MSB) or borrow into the MSB.
It's also used in bitwise shift operations to store the bit shifted out.
In unsigned arithmetic, it indicates overflow.

Z (Zero):
The Zero flag is set if the result of an operation is zero.
It's often used to check if the result of an operation is equal to zero.

N (Negative):
The Negative flag is set if the result of an arithmetic operation is negative.
It's typically determined by examining the most significant bit of the result.

V (Overflow):
The Overflow flag is set if an arithmetic operation results in an overflow condition.
This happens when the result of a signed operation is too large or too small to be represented in the number of bits available.

S (Sign):
The Sign flag is similar to the Negative flag. It indicates the sign of the result of an operation.
For signed arithmetic, it's typically set if the result is negative.

H (Half Carry):
The Half Carry flag is used in binary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic.
It indicates when a carry-out or borrow from the lower nibble (4 bits) to the upper nibble occurs during an arithmetic operation.
It's often used in operations where digits are processed individually.

T (Transfer):
The Transfer flag is used in some architectures for various purposes.
It might indicate the state of a transfer operation or a specific condition.
Its usage can vary depending on the architecture.

I (Interrupt Enable):
The Interrupt Enable flag enables or disables interrupts.
When set, interrupts are enabled and can be responded to by the processor.
When cleared, interrupts are disabled, and the processor won't respond to them.
